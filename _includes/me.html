My favorite area to work in is front-end web development, but I also like back-end as well. I’m interested in learning new technologies and frameworks. My goal at the moment is to become a fullstack developer and a full process designer. However longterm, I just want to build something amazing! I’m driven by the philosophy that coding is not merely a technical skill but rather a medium for art.</p><!--p Hey there! I’m David and I’m a freelance web designer and developer living in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I’ve been doing front-end web development for five years now and I’m loving every minute of it! Aside from that I’m in my third year of Software Engineering at the University of New Brunswick.--><!--p In my spare time I like to write poetry and short stories, play guitar, go sailing, and anything else that inspires me. My main goal in life is to create something great and lasting.--></div><div class="next-button btn-work fade ani-long"></div></div></div></section>
